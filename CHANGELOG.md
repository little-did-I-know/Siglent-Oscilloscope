### Changed
- Migrated live view from matplotlib to PyQtGraph for dramatic performance improvement
- Replaced timer-based acquisition with threaded worker pattern
- Enhanced waveform display with marker support methods
- Updated main window to integrate visual measurement panel
- Improved channel enabled detection to handle scope response format

### Fixed
- **Channel Detection Bug**: Fixed `channel.enabled` property failing to detect "C1:TRA ON" response format (channel.py:48)
- **GUI Freezing**: Moved blocking SCPI queries to background thread to maintain GUI responsiveness
- **Live View Startup**: Removed non-existent `refresh_state()` call that caused crashes
- **Waveform Update Performance**: Eliminated unnecessary canvas redraws during live view

### Dependencies
- Added `pyqtgraph>=0.13.0` to GUI dependencies
- Updated installation instructions for `[gui]` extra

### Technical Improvements
- Thread-safe Qt signal/slot architecture for live updates
- Abstract base class pattern for extensible measurement markers
- Dataclass-based configuration management
