"""Backward compatibility module for the 'siglent' package name.

DEPRECATED: This module provides backward compatibility for code using 'import siglent'.

The package has been renamed to 'scpi_control' to better reflect its capabilities:
- SCPI Instrument Control (scpi_control) supports oscilloscopes, power supplies,
  and function generators from Siglent and other SCPI-compatible manufacturers.

Migration Guide:
    Old import (deprecated):
        from siglent import Oscilloscope, PowerSupply, FunctionGenerator

    New import (recommended):
        from scpi_control import Oscilloscope, PowerSupply, FunctionGenerator

This compatibility module will be removed in v2.0.0.
